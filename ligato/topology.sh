All done. You can do the following to explore this setup further:
    Open a shell to a Ubuntu container:         docker compose exec node1 bash
    Open the VPP debug CLI of a node:           docker compose exec node1 vppctl
    Dump the etcd datastore:                    docker compose exec etcd etcdctl get "" --prefix
    Access ligato HTTP API with a browser:      http://localhost:9191
    Access the telemetry data explorer:         http://localhost:8888/sources/0/chronograf/data-explorer
    Teardown this demo:                         docker compose down
